# Changelog

This changelog is written with the goal of helping you through breaking changes rather than being a complete documentation of every change in the release.

### Upgraded to winit 0.30

Winit 0.30 overhauled the event loop -- now everything occurs through the [ApplicationHandler](https://docs.rs/winit/latest/winit/application/trait.ApplicationHandler.html).
Now rather than simply calling `WinitInputHandler.update()`, you have to call 4 different functions: `.process_window_event()`, `.process_device_event()`, `.step()`, and `.end_step()`, each in the corresponding function within ApplicationHandler.

The recommendations this crate gives about where to render and run your application logic have also been updated to match new guidance.
As `update()` has been removed, it no longer returns true when you should run application logic. Instead, run your application logic _after_ calling .`process_about_to_wait()` in `ApplicationHandler::about_to_wait()`.
Run rendering code in `ApplicationHandler::window_event()` only when `.process_window_event()` returns true, indicating it received a `RequestedRedraw` event. It doesn't care about which window was requested to be redrawn, but if you do, you'll have to handle it yourself. If you want to render every frame, remember to call `Window::request_redraw()` in `ApplicationHandler::about_to_wait()` every time.

## `step_with_window_events` removed

It seemed kind of broken since it doesnt process device events.
And winit 0.30 makes this issue even worse.
Something similar could be reintroduced in the future with more thought put into it.

## 0.16

* `WinitInputHelper::quit` is removed, instead use `input.close_requested() || input.destroyed()` for an equivalent check
* Mouse APIs now use <https://docs.rs/winit/latest/winit/event/enum.MouseButton.html> instead of a usize
* `WinitInputHeler::text` now returns <https://docs.rs/winit/latest/winit/keyboard/enum.Key.html> instead of the now deleted `TextChar` type

## 0.15

Upgraded to winit 0.29.
Winit 0.29 completely overhauled its keyboard API, which meant that I had to also overhaul our keyboard API.

Previously winit_input_helper favored logical keys over physical keys (previously called scancodes).
But this was a mistake, driven by winit's poor support for physical keys and mistaken simplification of logical keys.
Winit has now fixed these mistakes and as a result winit_input_helper is now swapping to favor physical keys.

A direct translation of the previous API to the new API:

```rust

// old
input.key_pressed_scancode(17); // US scan code for W
// new
input.key_presed(winit::keyboard::KeyCode::KeyW);

// old
input.key_pressed(winit::event::VirtualKeyCode::KeyW);
// new
input.key_presed_logical(winit::keyboard::Key::Character("w")); // WARNING: this likely wont actually do what you want, this will never return true while shift is held since that is considered as `W` instead of `w`

// ... other keyboard methods follow the same pattern
```

However, I actually suggest you move to physical keys:

```rust
// old
input.key_pressed_scancode(17); // US scan code for W
// new
input.key_presed(winit::keyboard::KeyCode::KeyW);

// old
input.key_pressed(winit::event::VirtualKeyCode::W);
// new
input.key_presed(winit::keyboard::KeyCode::KeyW);
```
